1. Responisve design maintains the same layout of the website, but shrinks or grows as the viewing window changes. Adaptive design changes the layout of the website when the viewing window changes.

2. Mobile first design would be designing a website for ideal viewing on a mobile device first before moving on to desktop design. In contrast, desktop first design starts with building the website to be desktop friendly first, and then to work on the mobile design.

3. A font size of 62.5% in the html tag allows REM to easily be calculated into pixels at a ret of 1 rem = 10 px. This is possible since the typical default browser font size is 16 px.

4. CSS is a early styling language that has many limitations. Preprocessors, such as LESS, allow for easier programming through the use of variables, nesting, and mixins.

5. My favorite concept of preprocessing is nesting since it allows for easier visualization of CSS components. Mixins give me the most trouble since I don't fully understand their function.
